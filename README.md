## What is the .NET nanoFramework Test Framework

nanoFramework TestFramework it's a Unit Test framework dedicated to .NET nanoFramework! It has all the benefits of what you're used to when using Microsoft Test platform for .NET or XUnit or any other!

The framework includes multiple elements that are distributed in a single NuGet package!

- `nanoFramework.TestFramework` which contains the attributes to decorate your code and the `Assert` classes to check that you're code is properly doing what's expected.
- `nanoFramework.UnitTestLauncher` which is the engine launching and managing the Unit Tests.
- `nanoFramework.TestAdapter` which is the Visual Studio Test platform adapter, allowing to have the test integration in Visual Studio.

The integration looks like that:

And the integration will point you up to your code for successful or failed tests:

![test integration failed](assets/test-integration-vs-failed.jpg)

## Usage of .NET nanoFramework Test Framework

Simply add the `nanoFramework.TestFramework` nuget to your project and you're good to go!

![test nuget](assets/test-nuget-test-framework.jpg)

Once you'll build your project, the tests will be automatically discovered:

![test discovered](assets/test-discovered.jpg)

You can then run all the tests and you'll get the result:

![test success](assets/test-success.jpg)

To have more details on usage of the framework, please refer to the detailed [documentation here](https://docs.nanoframework.net/).

## Know limitations

.NET nanoFramework Test Framework is supported by VS2019, only. We have no plans to address the shortcomings that prevent it from being used in VS2017.
Despite of that you can still run Unit Tests on VS2017 but only from the VS Test console.

## What you'll find in this repository

This repository contains the source of the core elements. You'll find them in `sources` directory. The Visual Studio projects in the root directory will open those elements. 

## Sample pack

You can find on our samples repo a [sample pack](https://github.com/nanoframework/Samples/tree/master/samples/UnitTest) with projects demoing how to use the Unit Test Framework.
